# Why the SNP50K skim cannot resolve zygosity — two mechanisms, with the math

This note derives, and backs with the cohort/panel data, *why* the SNP50K
genotype matrix looks the way it does — 97% REF / **0.00% ALT-hom** / 70% missing
among 73.4M cells (see [snp50k-cohort-provenance.md](snp50k-cohort-provenance.md))
— and why that shape is **not** simply "coverage too low." There are two distinct
causes, and both are calculable:

1. a **caller-prior artifact** that forces every low-frequency non-REF call to
   heterozygous and makes homozygous-ALT effectively impossible (§1); and
2. an **outbred-donor dilution** that makes most panel "variant" sites
   non-informative for the specific gamete captured in a cross, compressing the
   ancestry-state signal from the assumed `{0, ½, 1}` to roughly `{0, 0.15, 0.30}`
   (§2).

The consequence (§3): per-site zygosity is not recoverable, the emission means
must be **fit, not assumed**, and the useful unit is the segment, not the marker.

Notation: at a biallelic panel site the reference allele is the **B73** allele
(the sites are ascertained teosinte-vs-B73 on the B73 NAM5 reference, so B73 is
`0` by construction). $\varepsilon$ = per-read error/mismap rate
($\approx 0.003$–$0.01$ from B73 controls). $p$ = alternate-allele frequency at
the site across the cohort.

## 1. The het-inflation is a prior effect, not a likelihood effect

### 1.1 Single-read likelihood (necessary, not sufficient)

For a diploid site covered by a single read, the genotype likelihoods are

$$
L(\text{read}=\text{ref}) : \begin{cases}
P(\text{ref}\mid 0/0) = 1-\varepsilon\\
P(\text{ref}\mid 0/1) = \tfrac12\\
P(\text{ref}\mid 1/1) = \varepsilon
\end{cases}
\qquad
L(\text{read}=\text{alt}) : \begin{cases}
P(\text{alt}\mid 0/0) = \varepsilon\\
P(\text{alt}\mid 0/1) = \tfrac12\\
P(\text{alt}\mid 1/1) = 1-\varepsilon .
\end{cases}
$$

By likelihood alone, an **alt** read favors $1/1$. If genotype calling used the
maximum-likelihood genotype we would therefore see homozygous-ALT calls. We see
**none** (1,001 in 73.4M). So the likelihood is not what determines the call.

### 1.2 The posterior carries an allele-frequency prior

`bcftools call -mv` (the multiallelic caller) reports the **maximum a posteriori**
genotype. It places a Hardy–Weinberg prior at the site's estimated alternate
allele frequency $p$ (with a mutation-rate hyper-prior, `-P`, default
$1.1\times10^{-3}$):

$$
P(0/0)=(1-p)^2,\qquad P(0/1)=2p(1-p),\qquad P(1/1)=p^2 .
$$

The posterior is $\propto L\cdot P$. For a single **alt** read:

| genotype | posterior $\propto$ |
|---|---|
| $0/0$ | $\varepsilon\,(1-p)^2$ |
| $0/1$ | $\tfrac12\cdot 2p(1-p) = p(1-p)$ |
| $1/1$ | $(1-\varepsilon)\,p^2$ |

### 1.3 The decision boundaries

**HET vs ALT-hom.** $0/1$ is called over $1/1$ whenever

$$
p(1-p) > (1-\varepsilon)\,p^2
\;\Longleftrightarrow\;
\frac{P(0/1)}{P(1/1)} = \frac{1-p}{(1-\varepsilon)\,p}\approx\frac1p > 1
\;\Longleftrightarrow\; p < \frac{1}{2-\varepsilon}\approx \tfrac12 .
$$

So for **any allele rarer than ~50% cohort-wide, a single alt read is called
heterozygous, never homozygous-ALT** — by a margin of $\approx 1/p$.

**HET vs REF.** $0/1$ beats $0/0$ for an alt read when
$p(1-p) > \varepsilon(1-p)^2 \Leftrightarrow p > \varepsilon/(1+\varepsilon)\approx\varepsilon$.

Combining, the single-alt-read call as a function of $p$ is

$$
\widehat{g} =
\begin{cases}
0/0 & p < \varepsilon &(\text{alt read absorbed as error})\\[2pt]
0/1 & \varepsilon < p \lesssim \tfrac12 &(\textbf{heterozygous})\\[2pt]
1/1 & p \gtrsim \tfrac12 .
\end{cases}
$$

### 1.4 Where the cohort actually sits

Alternate-allele frequency spectrum over all 50,995 sites:

| statistic | value |
|---|---|
| mean alt AF ($\bar p$) | **0.0152** |
| sites with $p<0.01$ | 41.8% |
| $0.01\le p<0.05$ | 56.7% |
| $0.05\le p<0.1$ | 1.5% |
| $p\ge 0.1$ | **0.0%** |

Every site sits in the middle branch: $\varepsilon \approx 0.003 < p < 0.1 \ll \tfrac12$,
with a mean margin $1/\bar p \approx 66$ in favor of HET over ALT-hom. **This is
the 0.00% ALT-hom / het-only pattern, derived.** It is a property of the prior on
rare alleles, so it would persist at higher depth until $p$ approached $\tfrac12$
— it is *not* removed by adding reads.

### 1.5 Why the count caller escapes this

The consequence is specific to a caller whose prior is the cohort HWE frequency.
The count / BetaBinomial emission used by the ancestry callers does **not** inherit
it: its per-state prior is the breeding-design expectation (BC2S2/BC2S3 $f_1,f_2$),
and its "genotype" is the ancestry state decoded by the HMM, not a per-site MAP
under a rare-allele frequency prior. That is the concrete reason the hard `GT`
path is dead while the AD-count path recovers the donor footprint.

---

## 2. Outbred-donor dilution — most "variant" sites are silent per cross

Even setting the caller aside, the *signal itself* is far weaker than the naive
`{REF=0, HET=0.5, HOM=1.0}` alt-fraction model, because teosinte donors are
**outbred and heterozygous**, not inbred lines.

### 2.1 Panel provenance

The reference allele model is the Grzybowski (2023) resequencing panel
(`##source="schnable2021"`), filtered to biallelic SNPs with
`--min-af 0.05:minor` and intersected to the BZea HQ sites. **Not imputed.** So
panel sites are *common* teosinte-vs-B73 variants — segregating in the species,
but not fixed in any one accession.

### 2.2 Transmission model

The recurrent-parent (B73) gamete is REF (dose 0) at every panel site. A donor
individual has genotype $\{0/0, 0/1, 1/1\}$ with per-site frequencies
$\{f_0, f_1, f_2\}$; the gamete it contributes to the cross carries the **donor
(ALT) allele** with probability — the **transmitted donor dose** —

$$
d \;=\; f_2 + \tfrac12 f_1 .
$$

A panel site "distinguishes the donor gamete from B73" only when the gamete
carries ALT, i.e. with probability $d$. Everything else looks like B73.

### 2.3 Panel data

Per-donor-species genotype composition at panel sites (217-sample teosinte panel;
each row is the per-individual average):

| donor species | $f_0$ (REF) | $f_1$ (HET) | $f_2$ (ALT-hom) | het\|non-ref | **$d=f_2+\tfrac12 f_1$** |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| parviglumis (Zv) | 64.2% | 15.2% | 20.6% | 42.5% | **0.282** |
| mexicana (Zx) | 57.7% | 18.8% | 23.6% | 44.3% | **0.330** |
| luxurians (Zl) | 62.5% | 8.3% | 29.2% | 22.2% | 0.333 |
| diploperennis (Zd) | 59.4% | 12.1% | 28.5% | 29.9% | 0.346 |
| nicaraguensis (Zn) | 64.5% | 8.3% | 27.2% | 23.3% | 0.313 |

The heterozygosity is genuine (parviglumis per-sample het: median **19.4%**, Q1–Q3
11.3–21.0%, so not an artifact of panel het-undercalling). Two facts dominate:

- **$f_0 \approx 60\%$** — most panel sites are *not segregating in a given donor*
  (they are variants private to other teosinte lineages, kept by the union-style
  ascertainment); the donor gamete is REF there, indistinguishable from B73.
- of the sites that *are* non-REF, ~40% (parvi/mex) are heterozygous → the gamete
  loses the donor allele half the time.

Net: **$d \approx 0.28$–$0.35$** — only about **one panel site in three** carries
the donor allele in a transmitted gamete (fewer for the less-diverse donors). This
is the quantified form of "~1/5 of variant sites are actually variant between the
gametes."

### 2.4 The emission signal is compressed, not at {0, ½, 1}

Expected per-bin alternate-**read** fraction by NIL ancestry state, folding in the
dose $d$ (het sites emit an alt read w.p. ½; ref/ref sites w.p. $\varepsilon$):

$$
\mathbb{E}[\text{alt frac}] \approx
\begin{cases}
\varepsilon & \text{REF/REF (no introgression)} &\approx 0\\[2pt]
\tfrac{d}{2} + (1-\tfrac{d}{2})\varepsilon \approx \dfrac{d}{2} & \textbf{donor HET} &\approx 0.14\text{–}0.17\\[2pt]
d & \text{donor HOM} &\approx 0.28\text{–}0.35 .
\end{cases}
$$

So the three ancestry states live at roughly $\{0,\;0.15,\;0.30\}$ in
alt-fraction space, **not** $\{0,\;0.5,\;1.0\}$:

- REF-vs-HET separation is $\approx 0.15$ over an $\approx 0$ floor — a low-SNR
  *elevation above baseline*, which is exactly why the binned Gaussian-emission
  HMM is the right shape but low-confidence;
- HET-vs-HOM separation is $\approx 0.15$ ($0.15$ vs $0.30$) — barely resolvable,
  which is why the caller is het-biased and rarely finds donor-hom.

Note the label "donor HET" above is the state the caller *reports* most, not the
one the design expects most: by the BC2S3 single-locus frequencies donor-**hom** is
actually the more common introgression genotype ($f_{BB}=0.109 > f_{AB}=0.031$) —
the caller under-reports it purely because it is undetectable at $0.4\times$. See
[genotype-likelihoods-and-hmm.md](genotype-likelihoods-and-hmm.md) §2.

### 2.5 Empirical validation — $d$ from the real read fractions

We can estimate $d$ directly from the cohort AD, independent of the panel, by
conditioning on ancestry-segment state and reading off the mean alt-read fraction:
REF segments $\to \varepsilon$, HET $\to d/2$, HOM $\to d$
(`agent/estimate_dose_from_reads.R`, segments from RTIGER calls which resolve
zygosity; alt-fraction pooled over all covered sites of all NILs in a taxon).

| taxon (donor) | panel $d$ | REF-bg alt-frac | HET alt-frac ($\hat d/2$) | HOM alt-frac ($\hat d$) | $2\times$HET | covered sites |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Zd (diploperennis) | 0.346 | 0.0057 | 0.198 | 0.461 | 0.396 | 3.4M |
| Zl (luxurians) | 0.333 | 0.0071 | 0.164 | 0.363 | 0.329 | 1.9M |
| Zv (parviglumis) | 0.282 | 0.0048 | 0.157 | 0.342 | 0.314 | 5.3M |
| Zx (mexicana) | 0.330 | 0.0044 | 0.187 | 0.492 | 0.374 | 9.0M |
| Zh (huehuetenangensis) | 0.37\* | 0.0070 | 0.339 | 0.894 | 0.678 | 0.8M |

\*Zh panel $d$ is from $n=1$ huehuetenangensis (+8 perennis); poorly sampled.

Three things the reads confirm:

1. **The REF-background floor is $\varepsilon \approx 0.004$–$0.007$**, exactly the
   per-read error rate — the REF state emits at the noise floor, not 0 (matching the
   nilhifi anchoring rationale).
2. **The read-based $d$ reproduces the panel-genotype $d$** for the four
   well-sampled donors: the interval $[\,2\times\text{HET},\ \text{HOM}\,]$ brackets
   $d$, and both land at $\approx 0.3$–$0.4$ against the panel's $0.28$–$0.35$
   (Zl essentially exact: 0.329 vs 0.333). Two fully independent measurements —
   donor-panel genotype composition and NIL read fractions — agree that
   **$d\approx 0.3$, not $\approx 1$.** The reads run slightly high, consistent with
   (i) the specific donor accessions carrying more alt than the species average and
   (ii) HET segments absorbing some true-HOM markers (see next point).
3. **The HET/HOM split is not clean — as predicted.** Under the model $2\times$HET
   should equal HOM; instead HOM $>2\times$HET (e.g. Zx 0.49 vs 0.37) because at
   $0.4\times$ the caller thresholds the alt-fraction rather than resolving zygosity,
   so HET keeps the low tail and HOM the high tail. The estimator's own ambiguity is
   the identifiability limit this document is about. Zh is the extreme case
   (HET alt-frac 0.34, HOM 0.89): huehuetenangensis is the most divergent donor, so
   $d$ is genuinely highest, but the value is uncertain (panel $n=1$, strong
   het/hom bleed).

Estimates: `agent/dose_estimates_by_taxon.csv`.

### 2.6 The site-selection ceiling

Restricting to sites where the donor is **fixed-ALT** ($f_2\to1$, $d\to1$) would
restore the clean $\{0, \tfrac12, 1\}$ model. But "fixed in *this* donor" cannot be
known without the **donor accession's own genotypes**, which we do not have; the
`--min-af 0.05:minor` species panel identifies *common* variants, not
accession-fixed ones. This is a more basic reference-data gap than phasing/LD:
without the donor genotype we cannot even label which markers are informative for a
given cross. It is the fundamental reason low-coverage genotype-imputation results
from human aDNA or inbred-founder PHGs do not transfer here.

---

## 3. Consequences

- **Fit the emission means, don't assume them.** The state means are
  $\approx\{0,\,d/2,\,d\}$ with a per-donor $d$; a fixed $\{ \varepsilon, \tfrac12,
  1-\varepsilon\}$ emission is mis-specified. This is why RTIGER's per-taxon
  `fit_means` outperforms the fixed-mean count emission on this data.
- **Prefer donor-enriched sites where possible.** Selecting sites with high
  species-level $f_2$ raises $d$ toward 1 and widens state separation, up to the
  accession ceiling in §2.6.
- **Report honestly.** The donor *footprint* (where introgression is) is
  recoverable; the het-vs-donor-hom split is marginal ($0.15$ vs $0.30$); per-site
  zygosity is not recoverable and should not be claimed. For B1/anthocyanin QTL the
  mapping unit is the **segment/dosage genotype**, obtained by projecting the
  decoded ancestry state onto the markers within a segment — not per-marker calls.
